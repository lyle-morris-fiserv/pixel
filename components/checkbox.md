# Checkbox

Checkboxes are used for multiple choices, not for mutually exclusive choices. Each checkbox works independently from other checkboxes in the list, therefore checking an additional box does not affect any other selection.

## Usage

### When to use

- **Forms** - Cany be used in forms on a full page, modals, or on side panels.

- **Filtering and batch actions** - Used to filter data either on a page, menu, or within a component (molecule)

- **Terms and conditions** - Turning the checkbox input on or off can indicate if you agree to the terms.

- **List with sub-sections** - Used when there is a parent and child relationship. You can use a parent checkbox to make a bulk selection of all list items. Unchecking the parent deselects all the list items. Alternatively, you can select children individually when the parent is not selected, which is where the indeterminate state comes into play.
