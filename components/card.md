# Card

Cards are a highly flexible component for displaying a wide variety of content, including information, getting started, how-to, next steps, and more.

The system includes a basic card structure that responds to the grid. Cards can contain type, images and/or blocks of color. However, cards have no pre-set styles for the content inside. Card usage guidance focuses solely on basic card functionsâ€”not the information hierarchy within the tile or guidance around additional interactive elements that the card may contain.
