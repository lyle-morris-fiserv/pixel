# Double Diamond

## Point departure

The core question in almost any creative or design project is how to get from point A (Don’t know or Could be) to point B (Do know or Should be). This process might seem finite and straightforward at first sight. In reality, it is a never ending process, as creativity is the habit of continually doing things in new ways to make a positive difference to our life.

The Double Diamond is a structured design approach to tackle challenges in four phases:

1. **Discover /Research** — insight into the problem (diverging)
2. **Define/Synthesis** — the area to focus upon (converging)
3. **Develop/ Ideation** — potential solutions (diverging)
4. **Deliver /Implementation** — solutions that work (converging)

Phases of this process are either diverging or converging. During a diverging phase, you try to open up as much as possible without limiting yourself, whereas a converging phase focuses on condensing and narrowing your findings or ideas.

The four phases of the Double Diamond may be simplified and merged into two main stages of the process.

- **Stage 1 Doing the right thing** - Whatever you do, you ought to look for the right problem to solve or the right question to ask before you try to do so. This is all about what you do. 
- **Stage 2 Doing things right** - Once you have found the right question to answer or the right problem to solve, you want to make sure that you do this the right way. This is all about how you do it.

## Phases

### Discover (Research phase)

Understand the initial situation or challenge. Define what additional knowledge you need. Figure out how to obtain it. Interview and research.

- Rip the Brief - Analyze the initial situation and conclude how much more details and knowledge you kneed or want.
- Define your research scope, methods, prepare and plan your research.
- Conduct your primary (field) and secondary (desk) research.

**Output:** Unstructured research findings, documentation and findings.

### Define (Synthesis phase)

Understand and make sense of your research to define whether you are solving the right problem and phrase your vision accordingly.

- Lay out all your research findings and build themes and clusters go gain an overview.
- Find insights – the dormant truth behind the facts or the words between the lines.
- Deduce opportunity areas and potential fields of action.
- Form redefined “How might we” -questions based on the opportunity areas.

**Output:** A final brief, new or refined HMW-research questions or a strategy paper.

### Develop (Ideation phase)

Get into the solution mode by evaluating ways and means to solve the core issues you have deduced from your research synthesis.

- Ideate - generate as many ideas or potential solutions as possible.
- Evaluate the first ideas you want to bring into further exploration.
- Set the ideas, the design vision or your hypotheses to a point when you can make them tangible.

**Output:** A set of ideas, a strategic thesis, a concept, first design drafts, a vision or first prototypes.

### Deliver (Implementation phase)

Design, craft, develop your ideas and potential solutions into something tangible. Build, test and fail to learn and to do it again.

- Prototype, Test & Analyze (make your best ideas tangible, test them and see what you get out).
- Learn, Iterate & Repeat (bring in the learnings, maybe rethink, redo, retest).
- Build, Iterate & repeat as often as necessary (the better the results get the more you bring your product to a real-world, usable and stable product).
- Release your solution and push it out to your users.

**Output:** Your final product or the solution and answer to your original challenge.

## Diversion versus conversion

Each phase of this process either makes you diverge or converge. Diverging phases requires you to open up and take anything possible into account or develop as many ideas and potential solutions as possible. Converging phases require you to narrow down, get your ideas and approaches straight to make sense and decisions.

### Inspiration

**I have a design challenge**

- *How do I get started?*
- *How do I conduct an interview?*
- *How do I stay human-centered?*

### Ideation

**I have an opportunity for design.**

- *How do I interpret what I’ve learned?*
- *How do I turn my insights into tangible ideas?*
- *How do I make a prototype?*

### Implementation

**I have a innovation solution.**

- *How do I make my concept real?*
- *How do I assess if it’s working?*
- *How do I place for sustainability?*

## Strategy versus design

How does this framework align in an organizational context? When taking a step back, the four phases may be summarized as two main stages. Each stage aiming at a goal and resulting in an outcome, placing it in the corresponding organizational matrix.


### Stage 1 - Experience Strategy

The first two phases - Discover & Define - are all about “doing the right thing” (goal) and finding the right question to answer or the right problem to solve. This is when we talk about establishing an experience strategy (outcome).

### Stage 2 - Experience Design

The following two phases - Develop & Deliver - are all about doing things right (goal) and finding the right answer or the right way to solve the problem. That’s when we talk about executing the experience design (outcome).
